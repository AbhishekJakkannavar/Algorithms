### CONTRIBUTING!

#### Contributing to this repo

**Implementing new File/Directory Structure**
* Try to keep things as modular as possible, the new file/directory structure should be:
```
/DataStructures/file
ex: /DataStructures/Stack.go
/algorithms/algorithm/file
ex: /algorithms/bubble_sort/bubble_sort.go
``` 
#### How To:

1. Fork Repo on Web Page
2. `git clone https://github.com/{your-username}/Algorithms`
3. Code your files in the proper directory based on the instructions above
4. add all your files `git add your/directory/path/to/file/` (see new directory structure above)
5. commit your file changes `git commit -m "Whatever you did here, e.g. created Stack"`
6. push your changes `git push`
7. Create a Pull Request to master on Web Page

#### Alternate via Web

1. Fork Repo on Web Page
2. Make your changes to your forked repo
3. Make Pull Request to master
